## Overview

TitanReset is the first library to abstract DSR functionality for V5RC Teams. Follow the tutotials to get started!

DSR (Distance Sensor Reset) functionality refers to programatically determining the location of your robot during or before autonomous routines. This works by using trigonometry to determine the real distance of the robot from the walls and which sensors to use. DSR is not a perfect answer to the localization problem, but massively helps consistency of autons.
